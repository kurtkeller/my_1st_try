grab-number
===========

Script to lookup telephone numbers in online directories and provide
back the name for the number.

Cache

Looked up numbers are added to a cache for future lookups. Successful
and failed lookups can get a different cache lifetime.
The cache is always queried first. This is to be a good netizen and
prevent the online registries to be bombarded with identical queries.
